        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I used to be a hardware technician at an animation studio, but decided to step away for a while to focus on some independent projects. Now though 
          after talking to some friends they recommended that I give software development a try. After some reflection I came to the resolution that they 
          are right and so I am very excited to learn all I can here at Treehouse! </p>
        <p>In addition just a little about me personally all you really need to know is that I love storytelling in all mediums so books, tv, music, movies,
          video games, etc. Also I love to make jokes that may likely only be for my entertainment such as the little reference reversal of the default
          profile picture and profile name amongst others here. And I am very sorry about that I just couldn't resist :) And yes the other information on this site
          will too include both absurd info mixed will actual real facts about me. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are twofold the first being after completing this program and building my portfolio to land a job as a front end jr. web developer.
           Secondly is to create and host a website that for which the idea is top secret! Not even James Bond knows. Or Daniel Craig. Or Tarzan.

          <li>Python</li>
          <li>C#</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also I am potentially interested in learning about indie game dev one day which is why I listed C#. I know it is a very far away dream for now
          but who knows maybe one day I'll really master this code stuff.
